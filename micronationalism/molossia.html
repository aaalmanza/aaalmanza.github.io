    <p style="text-align: center;">Around Summer 2022 is when I first heard about the Republic of Molossia. A small, self-proclaimed independent nation residing in Dayton, Nevada run by a man who calls himself President Kevin Baugh. After going to their website and doing more research, I became more and more intrigued. For me, this opened the portal to not just Molossia, but micronationalism as a whole. Molossia has their own flag, coat of arms, government, capitol, laws, anthem, and so much more stuff that a normal country would have. During summer break I got a chance to visit this small country and I was very delighted. So much so that I went back for a second time in 2023, where I was able to take a picture with the president himself as the border separating the United States and Molossia.</P>
