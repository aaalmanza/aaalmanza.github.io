    <p style="text-align: center;">From that research that I did, I also discovered many, many more micronations. Among all of them was a more recently established nation next to the Salton Sea near the Mexican border. The Republic of Slowjamastan is a nation ran by radio host R Dub! or as he prefers to be called, Sultan Randy Williams. As part of a larger road trip I was doing in 2024, I was able to drive all the way down to Slowjamastan and see it for myself. As of now there aren't any buildings yet, but there are signs, a desk, and a massive flagpole. The entire territory is also broken up into 13 states.</P>
