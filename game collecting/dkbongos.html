    <p style="text-align: center;">After Nintendo's biggest mistake of letting Microsoft purchase Rare (who had previously developed all prior Donkey Kong games) the Donkey Kong franchise was in this weird limbo. For the next decade or so, every Donkey Kong release was either a spin-off or a port of an already existing game. From that era, we gained the rhythm game series Donkey Konga for the GameCube. This series used a special bongo-shaped controller to play, with 4 different actions you could do. Hitting the left drum, hitting the right drum, hitting both drums, or clapping. The controller had a built-in microphone that could detect clapping. Later on, Nintendo EAD (the team that would eventually become Nintendo EPD, the developers of most 3D Mario games and Donkey Kong Bananza) developed Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, an entire 2D platformer that was centered around using the bongos.</P>
