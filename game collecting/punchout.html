    <p style="text-align: center;">Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! is definitely one of my favorite games that came out for the NES. It uses boxing as a template for what essentially boils down to a puzzle game. It is an adaptation of the original arcade game (which was just called Punch-Out!!) except this time it featured real-world former professional boxing champion Mike Tyson. This version of the game was only in stores for about 3 years. After those 3 years, Nintendo's license to use the likeness of Mike Tyson had expired, so they rebranded the game to Punch-Out!! Featuring Mr. Dream.</P>
