    <p style="text-align: center;">I'm sure you're probably familiar with Wii Sports, considering it is the third most sold game of all time. The massive success of Wii Sports spawn a whole bunch of other spinoffs including Wii Fit, Wii Play, Wii Party, etc. However exclusive to Europe was another game, Wii Chess. If you could not tell by the title of the game, it is literally just chess. This game is an oddity, mainly because having a whole dedicated game for chess when it could've been fit into Wii Play for example was weird. My copy of the game comes from Spain, which is why the boxart says Wii Ajedrez.</P>
